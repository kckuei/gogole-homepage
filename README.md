-Comments
Boy, this is taking me a lot longer than I thought it would. 
The most challenging aspect remains figuring out how to space/lay things out correctly. 
I still haven't figured out how to get the footer to anchor to the bottom of the page correctly.
Using the developer console to toggle on/off elements to see their impact has been helpful, but minifying makes
reading the code a little less intuitive to me.
