-Approach
1. Read through Shay Howe Lesson 1 Tutorial
2. Reviewed free code camp tutorial
3. First iteration, visually inspected google home page, added elements, leveraged understanding from 1 and 2
4. Second iteration, used chrome developer tools to insepct and refine

-Comments
The most challening aspect was remembering/figuring out how to layout the boxes, had to review the CodeCamp tutorial.
It was obvious from the get go that using the grid/flex features would be very useful.
I started with getting the elements on the page, and tweaking them to look like the google homepage, then trying to arrange them 
In retrospect, I probably should have spent more time with the layout first, then styling after
Deciding how to organize the selectors, what to name classes/ids seemed a bit arbitrary as well
